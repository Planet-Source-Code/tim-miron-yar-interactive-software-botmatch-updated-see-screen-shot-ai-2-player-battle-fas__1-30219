README.TXT - Development notes for BotMatch 0.96


=================================================================

  INTRO for developers
     Botmatch doesnt represent the absolute best way of 
programming games in VB but shows some concepts that should
be learned by anyone who is interested in game programming in VB.
I made this project as a research project to teach myself about
the science, math, and the concept behind building a game in VB.
     Although VB isn't the fastest base to program a game in, it's
ease of use made it my first choice, And with a little API here and 
there the speed can be bumbed up significantly.

THINGS that aren't the best in this program include:

  - NO double buffering (i didn't use CreateCompatibleDC and 
CreateCompatibleBitmap API calls to create backbuffers.) doing this
would significantly improve framerates - I didn't learn howto do 
this until very recently and I will be adding this to the game soon.

  - NO sound as of right now, I am in the process of creating some 
sound effects for the game.

  - NO full-screen mode, this is not because I dont know how to 
change and restore resolutions/color settings but because not every
screen in the game is full sized at 640 X 480.

==========================================================

THINGS you WILL learn from this program

  - Great meathods of making some kick ass GUIs.

  - Collision detection, basic movement, arrays, graphics manipulation

  - Basics to game design

  - AI techniques (NEW)


===========================================================

WHATS NEW IN THE UPDATE
  - A revised GUI
  
  - functional AI player (which has actually beat me on occasion)

  - Revised Graphics (some things are old, but some are new)

  - Revised / Optomised coding
